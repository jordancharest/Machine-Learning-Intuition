This repo is for learning and practicing machine learning in Python, mainly through the use of scikit-learn. This work was done before I learned much of the math behind machine learning, and represents my attempt to learn the intuition behind machine learning. I used scikit-learn in order to abstract all the math away. In the Machine-Learning repo, I learned the math behind the machine learning algorithms and implemented them myself, using the built-in math computation abilities of MatLab.
